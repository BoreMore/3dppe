                            <p>3DPPE was originally started by Kyle Hampton, a sophomore from Wheeler High, when he heard about efforts to 3D print masks for healthcare workers from his dad. He then asked three of his friends from the school's robotics team who also had access to 3D printers to help him. They then got 5 more people to join. One of the 9 people, Stephen Leverone, <img alt="image of Ultimaker-3 printer printing a headband" src="media/recaps/2020-4-10/image1.png" class="article-img img-fluid" width="50%" style="float:right;">wrote to Wheeler High School's principal, Mr. Gillihan, and asked for help and resources. Soon, they had more than 50 people contributing. "In less than 48 hours," Stephen says, "we had raised nearly 6k dollars, the Marketing Club had a plan for social media, and [Wheeler's] HOSA joined in to get us contacts for the medical centers."</p>
                            
                            <p>3D printing is a type of manufacturing where a printer can make complex designs from a digital file by applying layers of filament successively until the design is completed. Plastic is the most commonly used filament, and there are many types of plastics, but it is also possible to 3D print with other materials such as glass and metal. 3D printing allows for the manufacturing of goods with relative ease and speed, so once COVID-19 began causing mask shortages, it was quickly realized that it's possible to give back to healthcare workers that are risking their lives by donating face shields. Since 3D printed shields are not guaranteed by the FDA to provide the same level of protection, they're not meant to be used in lieu of face masks. They're meant to prolong the life of a mask by protecting it from being coughed, sneezed, or breathed on by patients.</p>
                            
                            <p>The mask is made of two parts: a 3D printed headband and a plastic shield. The headband has pegs on it which fit into the holes on the shield; it's easy to quickly assemble. We primarily use Ender 3, Cr-20, and Ultimaker-3 3D printers for the headband, and the shield already comes in sheets. Only a standard hole puncher is needed to make the holes. The design for the visor's model was found online, and by testing different printer settings, the print time was shortened from two hours for one visor to one hour for two visors.</p>
